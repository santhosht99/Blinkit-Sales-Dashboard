# Blinkit Sales Dashboard


## Project Overview

This dashboard was created to analyze Blinkit's sales performance and fat content distribution across various outlets. It provides key insights into total sales, average sales, outlet performance, and customer satisfaction. By understanding these metrics, Blinkit can optimize its product offerings and focus on improving the sales of specific item categories based on outlet location and fat content preferences (low-fat vs. regular).

The dashboard allows Blinkit to assess how sales vary by outlet location and identify trends that could help in making informed business decisions to enhance profitability and customer experience.

## Steps Followed

- **Step 1**: Load the sales data into Power BI Desktop, ensuring the data is clean and free from null values where necessary.
- **Step 2**: Create a data model for the dataset using relationships between item types, outlet location, sales, and customer ratings.
- **Step 3**: Design an interactive filter panel to allow users to filter the dashboard by outlet location and other relevant fields.
- **Step 4**: Use card visuals to display key KPIs such as **Total Sales**, **Average Sales**, and **Average Rating**.
- **Step 5**: Generate various charts and visuals:
    - **Line chart**: For outlet establishment trends over the years.
    - **Pie chart**: For sales distribution by outlet type and fat content.
    - **Bar chart**: For item-wise sales.
- **Step 6**: Apply slicers to filter data based on outlet location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) for more granular insights.
- **Step 7**: Use a stacked bar chart to compare outlet performance based on sales, visibility, and ratings.
