Problem Statement
This dashboard provides insights into sales performance and helps Blinkit (India’s Last Minute App) to analyze key business metrics such as total sales, average sales, customer ratings, and outlet performance. By utilizing this dashboard, Blinkit can monitor and optimize sales across different outlets, evaluate customer satisfaction, and identify areas for improvement.

Through the dashboard, Blinkit can focus on improving sales for certain item categories, understand how different outlet locations are performing, and use customer ratings to refine their product offerings.

Since the average sales are low at some outlets (e.g., Tier 1 locations), and the average rating is 3.9, Blinkit should focus on enhancing the customer experience and sales strategies in these areas.

Steps Followed
Step 1: Load the sales data into Power BI Desktop, ensuring the data is clean and free from null values where necessary.
Step 2: Create a data model for the dataset using relationships between item types, outlet location, sales, and customer ratings.
Step 3: Design an interactive filter panel to allow users to filter the dashboard by outlet location and other relevant fields.
Step 4: Use card visuals to display key KPIs such as Total Sales, Average Sales, and Average Rating.
Step 5: Generate various charts and visuals:
Line chart: For outlet establishment trends over the years.
Pie chart: For sales distribution by outlet type and fat content.
Bar chart: For item-wise sales.
Step 6: Apply slicers to filter data based on outlet location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) for more granular insights.
Step 7: Use a stacked bar chart to compare outlet performance based on sales, visibility, and ratings.
Step 8: Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service for team collaboration and easy access.
